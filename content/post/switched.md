#OMG it really happened. I switched to windows. After some twenty years of personal Mac use, I decided to switch. Now I’m not a complete noob to windows. I had my fair share of windows 98 trouble shooting back in the day. You know, the days where buying a new computer really meant getting a beige box with a DOS floppy, and finding a windows cd and drivers and solving al the problems associated with owning a computer.

But the Mac was a big relief. It just worked. And, in a time where I needed to get actual work done, and I could afford a Mac, it was a very welcome relief. I managed for years to alleviate the price tag by selling after about two years, and getting a very reasonable return. So I went from a 12” MacBook to a 15” and then the black 13”, after which I stayed with the second generation MacBook air for two consecutive units, and eventually landing back at 12” with the 2015 MacBook.

And there it started to lag. As I started to get restless and wanting to update, there was no update available. So I waited, and waited, but a significant update fell short. As I wanted to stay with the small form factor, the 2019 discontinuation of the 12” model was a major disappointment. So, I stuck to my 12” until it started to show problems with charging, battery life and random quirks.

A new Machine was inevitable but witch one? As the departure from the 12” would land me in a category of Macs that was plagued by keyboard issues and were not on par with today’s processing specs, the decision to switch started to loom. There was a sparkle of hope with the introduction of the 16” MacBook pro, but the keyboard and spec update stayed limited to the largest Machine of the bunch.

So, here I am, typing this blog on a DELL XPS 13” only slightly larger than my 12” MacBook, but with an intel 10th gen CPU, 16 gigs of RAM and a 512 SSD. Throwing on a 4K touch screen with a 10% discount, costed a fraction of the price of a Mac. Though windows 10 is the real price to pay.

As being formally trained in the adobe suite, and wanting the full-fledged system integration of outlook exchange for work, going with a Linux distro only was not an option. Though I do plan on going for a dual boot at one point, for now I’ll stick to windows 10. The first week has been pretty painless.
