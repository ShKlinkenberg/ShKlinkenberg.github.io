As mentioned in my [previous grassroots blog](http://www.klinkenberg.amsterdam/post/gr_2019_blog_2/), creating the animation I wanted for my 3D tracking video wasn't that hard. This time I decided to follow my own advice and write the script first. After recording the audio in one session and trimming all the mistakes, I finally had an outline for the timing of the animation.

By importing the audio track into after effects, I was able to place the animation in such a way that it aligned perfectly. So I now have a synced animation that you can view in the clip below.

<div style="margin:15px 0 15px 0;">
<iframe width="100%" height="415" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SN2aH8iyiVw?start=29" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

Now the next puzzle will be the video recording. By first recording only the audio, I essentially ruined the possibility of doing a talking-head video. So, I plan to shoot some videos of only my hands explaining the animation without showing my head. And maybe try to do a lip-sync recording for a few parts.
