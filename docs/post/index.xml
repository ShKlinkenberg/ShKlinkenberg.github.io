      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s that time of the year again. the grass is turning green and so, it&amp;rsquo;s time for a new grassroots project. This time I&amp;rsquo;m going to dive into the word of 3D tracking in Adobe After Effect to create next level knowledge videos.
I was inspired by the awesome Peter McKinnen and his short tutorial on how to merge 3D graphics and video footage. I thought, how cool would it be to explain some statistical concepts and have it play out right in front of me on the table.</description>

      <description>So, we’re done with VR for lecture recordings. Why? We just can’t see the presentation, let alone the laser pointer. VR is out. Enter the next generation of presenter tools: The Logi(tech) Spotlight. The spotlight presenter promises to boost your confidence. But let’s ignore that nonsense.
 The Spotlight does deliver the main goal we had of merging the campus lectures and the online weblectures. The remote is able to project a digital spotlight on the screen which of course can be captured by the weblecture registration software that we have here on campus.</description>
