      <description>So, the webinar on distance assessment was received quite well. Apart from the 200 attendees and now almost a hundred views on YouTube, I also received many questions on how I created the presentation overlay as can be seen in the video below.

      <description>#OMG it really happened. I switched to windows. After some twenty years of personal Mac use, I decided to switch. Now Iâ€™m not a complete noob to windows. I had my fair share of windows 98 trouble shooting back in the day. You know, the days where buying a new computer really meant getting a beige box with a DOS floppy, and finding a windows cd and drivers and solving al the problems associated with owning a computer.</description>
