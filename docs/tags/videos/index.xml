      <description>So, itâ€™s taken some time before I could really start this grassroot project, but I finally got the ball rolling. Looking at my own plan in my previous post I immediately went another rout. As I will base my first video on my earlier screencast on ANOVA (in Dutch), I decided to download the auto generated transcript from my YouTube channel. This gave me a rough outline with timestamps and all.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s that time of the year again. The grass is turning green and so, it&amp;rsquo;s time for a new grassroots project. This time I&amp;rsquo;m going to dive into the world of 3D tracking in Adobe After Effects to create next level knowledge videos.
I was inspired by the awesome Peter McKinnon and his short tutorial on how to merge 3D graphics and video footage. I thought, how cool would it be to explain some statistical concepts and have it play out right in front of me on the table.</description>
